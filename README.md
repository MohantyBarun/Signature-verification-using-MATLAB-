# Signature-verification-using-MATLAB-
In the following project signature verification is done using MATLAB and the results can be visualised by a GUI .
The main aim of the project is to validate between forged signature and actual signature in order to ensure security and privacy.
The entire code has been implemented in the MATLAB platform and the results can be visualised via a user friendly GUI interface.
The key techniques that act as the backbone of this project are image preprocessing techniques.
In both the cases the signature is first preprocessed and then we move forward with the comparitive analysis by calculating the euclidean distance.
The final validation is done based on this calculation.No ML model is used for this purpose.
